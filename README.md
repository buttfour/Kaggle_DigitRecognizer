# Kaggle_DigitRecognizer
My first attempt at the Kaggle project Digit Recognizer.  Used the random forest classifier from the Python package sklearn.

My first attempt has classified the test data 96.843% correctly.  This puts me in the 46-th percentile of submissions with a rank of 674.  Not the best place to be, but I will take it for a first try.
